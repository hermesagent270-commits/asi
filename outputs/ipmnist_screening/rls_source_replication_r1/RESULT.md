# Result: source-bound replication of the RLS-residual gain (r1)

Development-grade, permanently nonpromoting. Pre-registration:
`PREREG.md` (frozen before any r1 shard ran).

## Decision: REPLICATED (directional, 60-task screen)

`rls_head_resid_l1_preset005` minus `sigma0_shiftnorm_d099`, seeds 0-2,
same runner, source `c9aba7b5` at the time of the run, v2 schema (`summary.json`):

| arm | mean | stderr | per-seed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sigma0_shiftnorm_d099` (remeasured control) | 0.86396 | 0.000204 | 0.8636 / 0.8642 / 0.8642 |
| `rls_head_resid_l1_preset005` | 0.86927 | 0.000098 | 0.8691 / 0.8694 / 0.8693 |
| paired diff | **+0.005307** | 0.000135 | +0.005553 / +0.005280 / +0.005087, all positive |

Frozen rule required mean diff > 0 with all 3 per-seed diffs > 0: met.
The remeasured control tracks the stored 60-task screen (0.86396) exactly;
the candidate tracks its stored screen (0.86938) within 0.00011.
No additional development seeds used, no threshold moved, no escalation to 200-task
from this turn (needs a separate pre-registration).

## Provenance

- 6 v2 shards in `shards/` (source tree `c55a4f2a…`, worktree clean at run
  time; runtime CPU, JAX 0.11.0, NumPy 2.5.1, Python 3.14.4).
- OOM note: a first `-P 4` launch was OOM-killed on this contended 30 GB
  box (exit 137); the 5 surviving shards were rerun serially (`-P 1`).
  The one completed parallel shard was kept (idempotent skip); all shards
  merge cleanly under one runtime binding.
- Merge required the identical derivation env (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`); a
  first merge without it failed closed on the v2 runtime binding, then
  succeeded with matched env. No validator, threshold, or test was
  weakened. No library source edited.

Review reproduced the summary exactly from the six v2 shards, excluding only
its creation timestamp. Seeds 0-19 were previously consumed development
seeds; see the correction in `PREREG.md`. This retained historical result is
not a measurement of later source revisions or authenticated execution proof.
