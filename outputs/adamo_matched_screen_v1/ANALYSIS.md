# AdamO matched bounded-development screen — analysis (v1)

Permanently nonpromoting development measurement. Fulfills the empirical
acceptance criteria of [#1560](https://github.com/SlopDotCash/asi/issues/1560)
(comparator merged in [#1620](https://github.com/SlopDotCash/asi/pull/1620)).

- Pre-registration (frozen before seeds 15601-15603 ran):
  <https://github.com/SlopDotCash/asi/issues/1560#issuecomment-5473394736>
- Runner: `asi-adamo-diagnostic`, schema `asi.adamo_dynamical_isometry_diagnostic.v1`,
  profile `bounded-development` (784-300-150-10 ReLU MLP, 8 tasks x 64 steps,
  one example per step), four frozen development seeds x four arms.
- Dataset: caller-materialized NPZ from `load_mnist_train()` (OpenML `mnist_784`
  v1, first 60,000 rows, [-1,1]) validated through `validated_ipmnist_data`;
  sha256 `eba9c88497f36270265fa7bea0e3f69661a8679bfe2ac474d94bcbcd47702b3a`;
  bound in every receipt.
- Retention: verbatim receipts in `receipts/` (sha256 manifest inside
  `analysis_summary.json`); analysis implementation in `analyze_adamo.py`
  reproduces the descriptive summaries. The all-positive/all-negative flags
  are descriptive sign checks, not preregistered decision thresholds.
- Measured on a clean tree at main head `c9aba7b54dedd647f8bd5f5c7bf6780b1413b676`
  (receipts bind the exact adapter/runner bytes by SHA-256). Runtime: CPU,
  JAX 0.11.0, NumPy 2.5.1, Python 3.14.4.

## Outcome: inconclusive-negative (retained)

At the matched 512-step qualification budget the AdamO decoupled Gram-isometry
step (lambda=1e-3, paper strength) produces **no measurable isometry
stabilization and no consistent accuracy, loss, or plasticity effect** against
its own exact mechanism-off reduction. The result is retained as a negative /
inconclusive outcome per the issue's acceptance criteria; it excludes nothing
at the paper's horizons and makes no claim beyond this budget.

## Inert reduction (bit-exact, all seeds)

`adamo_inert` equals `adamw_control` bit-for-bit on all four seeds (identical
per-task accuracy trajectories and final `parameter_sha256`):
`[True, True, True, True]`.

## Primary paired comparisons (mean per-task over 8 tasks, per seed)

`adamo_l1e3 - adamo_inert` (mechanism effect at matched budget):

| field | per-seed deltas (15600..15603) | mean | all-positive |
|---|---|---|---|
| accuracy | +0.005859, 0.0, +0.009766, 0.0 | +0.003906 | no (two exact ties) |
| loss | +0.000020, -0.000030, -0.000128, -0.000004 | -0.000035 | no |
| plasticity | -0.000313, +0.000248, +0.000896, +0.000012 | +0.000211 | no |

`adamo_l1e3 - adam_iso_joint_l1e3` (decoupled vs joint gradient mixing):

| field | per-seed deltas | mean | all-negative |
|---|---|---|---|
| accuracy | -0.007813, -0.013672, +0.003906, -0.003906 | -0.005371 | no |
| loss | +0.008267, -0.001560, -0.001859, +0.001669 | +0.001629 | no |
| plasticity | -0.016416, -0.003281, -0.000555, -0.005968 | -0.006555 | **yes** |

Neither paired comparison has accuracy improvement on every seed. Plasticity
is lower for the decoupled form than joint moment mixing on all four seeds.
These are descriptive observations; the preregistration established no
all-seeds-sign acceptance rule or scientific win gate.

## Jacobian / isometry readout (final task, sentinel row zero)

| arm | cond (clipped 1e12) | RMS dist from 1 | min/max singular value | weight-Gram penalty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| adamw_control | 2.28 | 0.9057 | 0.0549 / 0.1181 | 224.69 |
| adamo_inert | 2.28 | 0.9057 | 0.0549 / 0.1181 | 224.69 |
| adamo_l1e3 | 2.45 | 0.9109 | 0.0526 / 0.1290 | 224.67 |
| adam_iso_joint_l1e3 | 2.12 | 0.8765 | 0.0877 / 0.1860 | 178.27 |

(per-seed values in `analysis_summary.json`; the table shows seed 15600.)
The penalty did not pull the sentinel Jacobian toward isometry at this budget:
RMS distance from one and the clipped condition number are unchanged-to-worse
for `adamo_l1e3` versus the reduction control, and the weight-Gram penalty is
essentially unmoved. The joint-mixing ablation perturbs the Jacobian more
without an accuracy benefit.

## Resources (per arm-seed run; receipts bound)

data steps 512, updates 512, observations 512, model queries 1032, Jacobian
reverse rows 80, parameters 282,160, persistent numeric bytes 3,386,040, peak
Gram working bytes 360,000. Logical compute differs substantially by arm:

| arms | logical compute units per run |
|---|---:|
| `adamw_control`, `adamo_inert` | 600,436,480 |
| `adamo_l1e3`, `adam_iso_joint_l1e3` | 79,781,236,480 |

The accounting includes parameter touches and active Gram matrix multiply-adds.
The active mechanisms therefore use about 133 times the logical compute of
the reduction control at this matched data/update budget. Timing remains
telemetry-only; the records do not establish equal compute or latency.

## Declared identity

Provider `zai`, model `glm-5.3-flash`, client `Claude Code`; self-reported.
The contributor reports a measured-run receipt and private trace. They were
not independently authenticated in this review; the retained files and hashes
establish consistency, not execution attestation.

Review reproduced `analysis_summary.json` exactly from all four receipts and
matched their adapter/runner hashes to `c9aba7b5`. The current strict validator
rejects these historical receipts on runtime drift (recorded Python 3.14.4
versus the project review runtime); its gate was not weakened. This retention
is not current-validator acceptance or a new measured run.
