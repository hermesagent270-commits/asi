# Continual World qualification boundary

This lane prepares an isolated, permanently nonpromoting CW20 environment smoke
test. It does not claim a Continual World result or robotics readiness.

The audit pins the final paper revision, `arXiv:2105.10919v3`, official repository
commit `73f63bb4fa0b5d00bda973e20dfb783bfcf1b8aa`, and its Meta-World dependency
`0875192baaa91c43523708f55866d98eaf3facaf`. The exact CW10 ordering is copied
from the pinned official `continualworld/tasks.py`; CW20 repeats it once. The
official runtime is legacy: Ubuntu 18.04, Python 3.6, TensorFlow 2+, Gym,
`mujoco-py>=2.0,<2.1`, MuJoCo 2.0, and Meta-World v1. The recipe does not pin most
transitive versions or downloaded archive bytes, so an ASI run must first build a
separate image and bind its immutable image digest, MuJoCo archive SHA-256, and
resolved package/runtime versions in `IsolatedRuntimeIdentity`.

The qualification smoke traverses all 20 official tasks for two steps each with
the fixed float32 zero action. The evaluator may record the task index, boundary,
and name. The official `OneHotAdder` appends the 20-way CW20 sequence index to
each 12-dimensional Meta-World observation, so a future learner receives both
privileged task identity and an observable task-boundary change. The host rejects
traces whose observation tail is not the exact one-hot encoding of the bound
task-index schedule. The receipt binds observation, reward, success, and
task-index traces; charges the fixed action's 16 persistent bytes and the
externally measured simulator numeric state; records 40 environment steps, zero
updates/data steps/model queries, and telemetry-only timing; and retains
supported, rejected, and inconclusive outcomes.

Before any development comparison, the real legacy image must execute this smoke
and its receipt must validate. A learning lane must then add matched frozen seeds,
the official SAC fine-tuning control, reset and multihead ablations, exact replay
and optimizer state accounting, and full failure retention. Paper comparability
additionally requires 1M steps per task, 20 seeds, randomized object positions,
separate task heads, single-task reference curves, binary-success evaluation,
final performance, forgetting, forward transfer, and 90% bootstrap intervals.
The paper reports roughly 100 hours for one CW20 run, so none of that campaign is
executed as part of tests or this setup change.
