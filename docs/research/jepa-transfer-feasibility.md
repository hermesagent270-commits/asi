# JEPA-WM / V-JEPA 2-AC transfer feasibility

This is the permanently nonpromoting native feasibility lane for issue `#1577`.
It tests one narrow architectural question: can an encoder learned from earlier
ASI transitions be frozen, transferred into a fresh action-conditioned
predictor, and consumed by a live controller under explicit costs?

  hours of DROID robot video. The pinned repository exposes 300M–1B parameter
  V-JEPA 2 checkpoints and a ViT-g/16 action-conditioned checkpoint.

  real-world navigation/manipulation, reporting gains over DINO-WM and
  V-JEPA-2-AC.

Both exact GitHub commit pages and repository trees were inspected. The pins
are provenance only; external code, checkpoints, and datasets are not imported
or executed by this lane.

## Native transfer experiment

The runner stores a bounded ASI-only `SwitchingTwoStateMDP` transition trace,
takes one trainable-encoder pass over it, and transfers only the learned encoder
into a freshly initialized predictor. That predictor then selects actions from
predicted rewards during an A/B recurrence. Frozen seeds, environment horizon,
pretraining trace length, warm-up, and exploration schedule are matched.

The roster separates:

1. encoder-only ASI transfer;
2. no-pretraining with the same frozen random-feature architecture;
3. a permuted transferred-encoder causal control (the transferred encoder with its
   weight entries shuffled under a seed-bound key; a latent-coordinate permutation
   would be undone by the fresh predictor);
4. a full encoder-and-predictor warm-start ceiling;
5. transferred encoder with its decision interface disabled;
6. exact no-model mechanism-off; and
7. the current SARSA agent as a strong live control.

Decision-off must reproduce mechanism-off action and reward hashes exactly.
Every arm reports environment/pretraining steps, pretraining examples and
updates (including applied encoder updates), imported-pretraining bytes (always zero), stored pretraining replay
bytes, online replay bytes (always zero), semantic encoder/model/control query
counts, encoder and total persistent bytes, environment bytes, and scoped
`perf_counter_ns` telemetry for pretraining, decisions, online updates, and
environment/control execution. Timing is process-local telemetry only, never an acceptance metric.
Semantic query counts describe public model operations; they are not FLOP or
kernel-launch estimates. Hashes are consistency bindings, not execution proof.

Run `asi-jepa-transfer-feasibility`. It prints one strictly validated JSON
receipt and never writes `outputs/`. Negative outcomes remain recorded and the
schema forbids scientific promotion or visual/robotics parity claims.

## Explicit gaps

This two-state, one-hot, one-step JAX lane is not a visual JEPA reproduction. It
has no video masking/tokenization, transformer encoder, target-encoder EMA,
image-goal energy planner, multistep latent rollout, DROID/web-video data,
imported checkpoint, camera calibration, or physical robot. It also lacks
paper-exact datasets, preprocessing, model scales, planners, horizons, metrics,
and seeds. External feasibility still requires an isolated PyTorch/CUDA runtime,
asset checksums and licenses, exact checkpoint/data/pretraining receipts,
matched planning budgets, qualified accelerator memory/FLOPs/latency, longer
recurrence and stochastic-retention tests, untouched evaluation seeds, and
robot safety/veto, control-frequency, sim-to-real, and hardware gates.
